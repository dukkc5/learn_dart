/*
The on keyword restricts the scope of a mixin.

It's like a GATE â›” "input requirement".

When you write mixin A on B, it means:

"This mixin A can only be used by classes that extend B."
The most important reason: Because mixin A wants to call functions or use variables inside class B, even though A itself did not define them.

on is a promise that guarantees: "Don't worry, whoever uses me (mixin A) will definitely have B's functions/variables available for me to use."
